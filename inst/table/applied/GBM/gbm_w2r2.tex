\caption{$W_2 R^2$ statistics for the the training, validation, and test data.
             The null models in each case are an intercept only model using the resection status
             over time. The models are the same in the training and validation cases meaning that
             the validation data evaluates an out of sample fit. The test data model was
             fit on an interpretable neighborhood around the test point and then evaluated
             at the test data.}
